emphasized throughout the course.

## Schedule
July 10 - July 28, Monday - Friday 12:30 - 3:00


## Grading

 - 40% : Demonstration of an understanding of CS teaching methods through class discussion, breakout rooms, small presentations.
 - 30% : Final portfolio
 - 25% : Assignments


## By the end of this course, students will be able to:
   - develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans and materials.
   - Plan and deliver effective computer science instruction.
   - assess learning and differentiate instruction for diverse populations.
   - Employ a variety of effective pedagogical standards in order to deliver instruction aligned with the proposed CSTA standards.
   - Use current technology and CS content and will be able to learn new technologies and content. Teacher-candidates will be able to develop coherent, meaningful goals, plans, and materials.
